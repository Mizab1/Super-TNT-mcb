Simply punch right under the scoop of the catapult to release it. Reload! Throw another obsidian block right into the center of the catapult in order to reload it. kill all the catapult using /function mtnt.main:kill_catapult

----- Revise
- 1) keep inventory @done
- 2) put crash sound to the car or skidding sounds @done
- 3) for the star rain, we need real stars not a charge ball, maybe you can put the Mario star sound while is raining, and add a lot stars and less explosive @done
- 4) for the earthquake tnt, can you do a crack/rift  in the  floor? i guess that you can clone air blocks from a real rift pasted somewhere, that would be the easier way, with breaking particles blocks @done
- 5) set gravity time to 2 seconds @done
- 6) "maybe something is missing from your inventory", that means that not always works? @done
- 7) disable weather like always @done
- 8) the skycrapper is ok, but we need the double of height, maybe you can paste it twice @done
- 9) i think that the word is not cringe, in the ads tnt, should to be die for boring. isn't it? and also can you force his looking at pls @done
- 10) the teleport tnt has to clone a section of map around the player and put it back somewhere else, that's the idea, an area of like 9x9x5 around him @done
- /clone ~-4 ~-4 ~-4 ~3 ~3 ~3 ~10 ~ ~-12 replace move
